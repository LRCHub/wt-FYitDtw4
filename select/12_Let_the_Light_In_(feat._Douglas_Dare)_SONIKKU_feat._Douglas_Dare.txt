Oh, let the light in

The days are long, the nights are cold
You're questioning what the future holds
What happened to all those hopes and dreams
They fell apart, loose at the seams
Buildings tall and buildings high
Concrete towers fill the sky
They're offices where people slave
Working their way to an early grave

Oh-oh-oh
You've got to have it all
Oh-oh-oh
I see it in your eyes, living for the rise and fall

Let the light in
Let the light in
I'm thinking about, thinking about you
Let the light in
Let the light in
I'm thinking about, thinking about you

Slowly, we fade to, fade to grey
Day after day
Maybe we'll will find another way
To let the light in

Discarded like a plastic bag
An average life you'll never have
In our heads we choose to ignore
Reality, we close the door
You've got the suit, you've got the tie
You'll never cheat, you'll never lie
Always leave them wanting more
Dreams come true when kept offshore

Oh-oh-oh
You've got to have it all
Oh-oh-oh
I see it in your eyes, living for the rise and fall

Let the light in
Let the light in
I'm thinking about, thinking about you
Let the light in
Let the light in
I'm thinking about, thinking about you

Slowly, we fade to, fade to grey
Day after day
Maybe we'll will find another way
To let the light in

Let the light in
Let the light in
I'm thinking about, thinking about you
Let the light in
Let the light in
I'm thinking about, thinking about you

Slowly, we fade to, fade to grey
Day after day
Maybe we'll will find another way
To let the light in
To let the light in, oh-oh-oh
To let the light in, oh-oh-oh
