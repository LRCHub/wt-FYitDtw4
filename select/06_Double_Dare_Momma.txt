Morning in July
Got a souped up
Motor on the county line
Dressed in my Sunday best
Sucker punch right into a picket fence

Comets in the sky
Bloody white knuckles couldn't hold you tight
Guys from out of town
Sucker punch me into the ground
Double dare me to stick around

I'll be a star-studded champion
And I'll go far from the world we're in
So stay right there
I double dare, double dare
Stay right there
I double dare, double dare

Trigger happy kids
Ring around the tussle, placing bids
Pockets full of molars as they fall
Sucker punch now I'm standing tall

I'll be doing time
Southbound from the county line
Kiss you on the cheek
Fairgrounds never seen a chief like me
Double dare written on the marquee

I'll be a star-studded champion
And I'll go far from the world we're in
So stay right there
I double dare, double dare
Stay right there
I double dare, double dare
