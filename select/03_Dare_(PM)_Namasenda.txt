Live different lives when you're not with me
And you don't smile when you're around me lately
It feels so cool when you say you love me
It could be simple, but it's not

Call me if you dare (call me if you dare)
I know it's hard to, running out of air (out of air)
But we could break through
Call me if you care, or just pretend to
Call me if you dare
We can speak on the phone
Hang up if you want to
We can speak on the phone
Hang up if you want to (if you want to)
We can speak on the phone
Hang up if you want to

You never wanna sleep over
You never hold me when you're sober, do you?
When we're together, just to be together
It's all so simple, but it's not

Call me if you dare (call me if you dare)
I know it's hard to, running out of air (out of air)
But we could break through
Call me if you care (if you care), or just pretend to
Call me if you dare
We can speak on the phone
Hang up if you want to

Oh-oh-oh-oh, dare, dare
Oh-oh-oh-oh, dare, dare (speak, speak, speak)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, dare, dare (we're holding onto)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, dare, dare (if we just pretend to)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, pick-up if you dare (if you're there)
Kiss me, call me if you dare

Call me if you dare, call me if you dare (i know it's hard to)
Call me if you dare, call me if you dare (that it is)
Call me if you dare, call me if you dare
Call me if you dare (if you dare), call me if you dare
Call me if you dare, call me if you dare
Call me, call me, call me if you dare (if you dare)
Call me if you dare, call me if you dare (i know it's hard to)
Call me if you dare, call me if you dare (that it is)
Call me if you dare, call me if you dare
Call me if you dare (if you dare), call me if you dare
Call me if you dare, call me if you dare
Call me, call me
We're holding onto
If we just pretend to
Pick-up if you dare, if you're there
