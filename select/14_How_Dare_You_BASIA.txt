Your voice that sounded soft and sweet
Your manners knocked me off my feet
Infatuation made me blind
Today I know you are someone else
Than the one I keep in my mind

So now you think I'm yours
And you don't have to try
Seems nothing I do is right

How dare you talk to me like that!
If you're not careful I'll get mad
How dare you talk to me like that!
Let this be a warning

You made me hope we'd live a dream
But now you make me want to scream
Poetic style turned into prose
This gentleman that once I knew
I wonder if it was really you

'Cause now you think I'm yours
And you don't have to try
Seems nothing I do is right

How dare you talk to me like that!
If you're not careful I'll get mad
How dare you talk to me like that!
Let this be a warning

Now you think I'm yours
And you don't have to try
Seems nothing you do is right

How dare you talk to me like that!
If you're not careful I'll get mad
How dare you talk to me like that!
Let this be a warning

Let this be a warning to you (let this be a warning)
Let this be a warning to you (let this be a warning)

How dare you talk to me like that!
How dare you talk to me like that!
How dare (how dare) you talk (you talk) to me (to me) like that (like that)
How dare (how dare) you talk (you talk) to me (to me) like that (like that)
How dare you talk to me like that...
